933-181. Vascones they tell us, lengthened life by food like this:
but that was fortune's spite and war's extremity,a lon blookade
and famine. Such cases we should pity, when, after all their food is
gone to the last blade oi' grass, men eat eaoh other, as they would
themselves: these gods and men may pardon, as the ghosts would do
of those they ’ve eaten. Zeno ma teaoh us all things must not be done
even for life; but how should tbey be Stolos, and that in old Metel·
lus's time? Now all the world have got our learning and the Gre-
oian too. Gaul teaehes Britain how to plead, and Thule talks of
hiring soon a rhetorioian. But yet that noble people and Saguntum
had some excuse for what they did. But Egypt was more savage
than the Tauria altar; for there (if we're to trust the story) the
goddess only saorifieed the men, and nothing more. What led these

She bids us weep for friends in sorrow, for the poor wretoh on trial
for his life, or boy, that brings his fraudulent guardian to justitae,
with weeping faoe and streaming hair. She bids us weep whena
young muiden dies or little babe. What {md man and true but
counts all human miseries his own? ’T is t is distinguishes us men
from beasts; ior this ve've minds to take in thin divine and exer-
oise all arts; and sense from heaven, whieh they ave not who look
d'own to the earth. They 've breath but we have soul. so that sym-
path bids us seek mutual help, join in communities, and quit the
woo s ou'r fathers lived in, build houses, join our habitatione for
mutual safety, stand by esch other and roteot the fallen, fight side
by side at one signal, share the same walls and towers. But now the
snakes are more lrarmonions than we are; the wild beast preys not
on his kind: but as forman 't is not enough to have forged the fatal
sword, though the first smiths knew only to make tools. But now
we see whole peoples not content with killing in their passion, but
they must eat each other. What would Pythagoras say, where would
he run to, ir he saw these monstrous doings, he who ahstained from
all kinds of meat and ate not every kind of vegetable t-MACLEANE,

and Oioero (N. D. i. 36) speak of it as destroying dying serpents.
