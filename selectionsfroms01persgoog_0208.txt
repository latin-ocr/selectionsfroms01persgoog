But you excuse yourselves,.ye 'l'roJ'an-born. brutus may do what
would disgraee a oobbler.

188-210. Bad though this be, yet worse remains behind. His
money spent, Damasippus goes upon the stage, and Lentulus aete
Laureolus not badly, deservrng, as I think, areni orosa. The people
are to blame to sit and see patriaian buffooneries. At what prree
they sell their honor matters not. No tyrant foroes them, and yet
the gladly sell themselves to tho Praetor for his shows. And even
ii tbe ohoioe were that or death, whioh should they ehoose? Does
aillritfttittdltlltt hiltlltirltllllgfftal
we 've bada harper like Nero ior our em eror. After all thrs, what
ean there be but gladiatorial shows? ki'his, too doth shame the
town; Graoohua, a noble and apricat, not with heimet or slrield, but
as a retiartaa,undisguised aud with faae unoovered, oaets his net,
and falling dies the arena round in sight of all the theatre. His
tunio and his oa betray the priest oi' Mare: ean we believe it?
More ehame it is titan any wound ior him who suffers the degradation
offi htrng with apriest.

ali-230. Were but the o le free, who but would ohoose a Seneca
belone a Nero? The datieoimany parricides was his desert Hie
orime was lrke Orestes', but 1t differed ln the cause. One, brd by
gods, avenged his father'e murder; but he slew nothis sister or hu
wife: he poisoned no relations, never aoted, never wrote a rubbishy

m ou the Trojan War. What is there that Nero did wlrioh eo
aranearumreserataeaaaaar
foreign theatres and earn the parsley erown fr’om Greeks! Hang up

{our dresses and your maske and harp, the trophies oi your glory,
efore the statues of your anoestrrs!

231-288. Catilina and Cethegus were of lolty birth, and yet they
would have fired the aity, like savages, fit to be punished with the
shirt of pitoh. But our Consul was awake; a new man and not
noble guarded the whole town, aud got more fame in peace than all
Octavius won at Aetium or Philip i. Rome was then free, and ealled
our Cicero hia country’s Father. is townsman too, Marius, followed
the plough for hire, and had the vine-switoh broken over his head

· iatheranks. But he stood single-hanuet, and withstood the Cimbri

and delivered Rome, and when the light was over he was orowned
before hie oollea ue. The Deoii were plebeiam, yet were their lives
offering enough ior all the host ; they were worth more than all that
they saved. Α slave's son wore the orown of Romulus, and was our
last good king. The Consul's sons would have betrayed the ait ,a
slave betrayed their urpose: he worthy to be wept by matrona, tbey
deserved to die, the ret oondemned by righteous laws.

269-275. You¹d better be Thersites' son and like Achilles, than
like Thersites aud Achilles’ aon. But go as far bank as you will, ou
still aomo to the asylum, and whosoe’er was founder of your iine
mujtfilzrere been a shephord or something worse. - Machaerus with
mo t norw.
