ARGUMENT.

1-11. In all the world, bnt few oon tell good ¹from its opposite.
When ure our leurs or ho es uided hy reason? What wish when
guined is not repented ol? lhe gods, too kind, ruin whole houses
ut their own desire. In pesce und war we pray for what must hurt
us: the giu of eloquenee or sinewy arms ure fatal both elihe.

12-27. But more ure ohoked with money, that theirs shallexoel all
other men’s fortunus. For this in tyrannous times by N ero’s bidding
Longinus, Seneca, and Lateranus were shut up in t eir houses: bnt.

laufih forever yet those towns had no abuses like our own. Suppose

he ud seen the Praetor going to the gemes in his tall ohariot with

Jove’s tnnie on, with folds ol lnurple toga, sud a grest erown, too

big for sny neck, borne by a s ove placed in thesemo ohuriot with
him, of oourse to lower his pride; sn engle on his ivory staff, on one
side trumpeters, on the other friends und citizens in white, friends
whom his dole makes such. Why, even there he laughed st every
turn, showing thot men of mind ore found even in dullest times. He
rnooked the cures, the j ys, sometimes the very teurs ol men, bado
