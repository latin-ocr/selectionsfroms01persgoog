ARGUMENT.

1-9. Atnflouers Ι am distressed at the departure of my old friend
Umbricius,l commend him for preferring a quiet lrorne in Cam-
pania to the fires and falling buildings arrd the thousand perils and
the reciting Eoets of Rome.

10-20. W ile his family and goods were all being pached iutoa
single cart, Umbricius halted at the Capenian gabe. H ere we stepped
down into Egeria’s vale and grottoes-how all unlike the true!
How far more manifest were the divinity of the stream, ii' grass
edged its waves with green, and uo marble profaned the native tufa!

21-57. “Since'’ says my friend, “there is no roonr sor honest
industry at Rome, l will find a home elsewhere, while Ι have yet
vigor to go. Theywho can make blaek white, and are willing to
stoop to the meanest and most dishonest occupatione, nray stay here
aud thrive. Such men can give the yeople shows, and then go back
to their low trades. And why should they not thus shift about,
since they only imitate Fortuue, who has raised them? What is
there for mc to do at Rome? Ι cannot flatter, nor be au instrument
of crirne, nor privy to the crimes of the great. Not for all the gold
of the 'fagus should you be willing to forego your peace of mind by
harboringaguilt secret. . .

58-80. “I ll ted you in whom our rrch men mostdehght, and whom
I most avoid: 't is Greeks, and worse, ’tis Syrians: for Syria has
gourcd her refuse into Rome,mber languere, cnstoms, harps, and

robes? Shall that man, blown to Rome by the same wind as dgs
ond damsons, rank before me, whose infancy breathed the air of
Rome? They can flatter most grossly, and yet be believed. What
fflayer on the stage can surpass them? Not even Antiochus or

acutus would seem wonderful among the Greeks, for the whole
netion are cotors in daily life. ila—125. Pass on to a graver crime.
