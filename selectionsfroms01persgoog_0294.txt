The publication of this edition of the Classica was suggested by
the coustantly increasing demand by teochers for an edition which,
by Judicious notes, would give to the student the assistance really
necessary to render his study profluuio, furnishing explanations of
passages difficult of interpretation, of peculiarities of syntax, eta,
and yet would require him te make faithful use of his Grammar and
Dictionary.

It is believed that this Classical Series needs only to bc known to
iusurc its very general use. The Publishers claim for it peculiar
merit, end beg leave to call attention to the following important par-
ticulars:

The purity of tlre texts.

'l'he clearness and conciseness of the notes, aud their adaptation to
the wants of studente.

The beauty of the type and paper.

The handsome style of binding.

The convenience of the shepe and siae.

The low price at which the volumes are sold.

The preparation of the whole Series ir tho oriqtnol work of Ameri-

. can scholare.
