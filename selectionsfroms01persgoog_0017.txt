X INTRODUC'I'ION.

the precise limits of possible variation in quality between
different productions of the same mind. It would not

nal's satiras. Nor is a satisfactory explanation of the

We have more reason to doubt whether all the
satiras as we have them received their author's final
touches and editorial revision. Caralessness may account
for some of the faults which have been charged to forgery.

It is generally safe to leave a reader to discover and

with a few broad touches‚ in which the salient points are
always brought into the foreground; and it has bean well
observed that a painter of kiudred genius would have
