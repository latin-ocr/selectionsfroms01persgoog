ARGUMENT.

1-11. ln you are not yet eshamed. Trebius, 01 the life you have

had your dinner, you 've got your full reward ; though it eomes bnt
seldom, your patron, Virro, puts it down 10 your account. Onne in
two months he has a vacant plane at his table, end says, “ Come and
dine:’' the height of your ambitioni tbe reward for which you are
ready to break your rest, iu order to antieipate your brother parasitos
in the officium salutandi at unoonth bonrs 01 the morningl 24-79.
And what kind of e dinner is it? The wine is suoh thut wool refuses
it. 11 11 gets into your head, Virro's freedmen are read to piok a
, quarrel with yon for his amusement. The host, meanwhiie, is drink-
ing the olroieest‚ oldest wines. Virro's cupa are jewelled, yonrs of

107-113. But nowaword with the rich man himself. Nobody

aska of yon the bonuties which good rioh men 01 old would send to ·

their poor friends. We only beg you 'll dine as a fellow-eitizen with
his equals; then s eud your money as yon please.
