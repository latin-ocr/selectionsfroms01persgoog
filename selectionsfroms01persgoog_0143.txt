Tigellinus. The ornei and wauton favorite 01 Nero, aud his ac·

complice in the burning 01 Rome.

Pone: lucebis, etc. (Satirize Tigellinus, end you’ll fare as the
Christiane did.) This is an elegant construction, equivalent 10 εἰ
ponae, locabis. “ln such cases Cicero never inserts et before the
apodosia. Later writers insert or omit it indifferently.”

Next to the above, I should prefer that which translates tuedo io
illa “in that torch” 01 “those torches; ” reference being made to
Nero's execution 01 the Christiane (whom he falsely charged with
setting fire to Rome, 10 avert the odium 01 the crime from himself
and his iuvetite), by covering their bodies with tar and setting fire to
them, “ that they might serve 101 torches end give light 10 the spec-
tatore, they being so tasuned thet they could not bend their bodies.’'
Asimilar meaning has been brought out by translating tuedo “a
pitched shirt,” tunica ewlesta (viii. 2355 but it would be hard to Α
find authority for the use 01 the word tuedo in that sense.

In deducit we have the lively use 01 the present 101 the future,
picturing the scene us if now going on. The allusion is 10 the drag·
ging away 01 bodies through the arena, either living, 101 execution,
01 after death. The MSS. vary between this reading and deducit
and diducit. In P. the last letter is entsed 01 illegible. Deducta is
adopted by Heinrich, Jahn, Hermann, Ribbeck, Mecleeue ς Mayor
and Madvig (opusc. ii. 177) read deducit, supplying in thought the
relative quoa referring to tuedo. Various emendations heve been
proposed, the neatest 01 which (offered in the Porsen tracto) is qaue
ducit, '
