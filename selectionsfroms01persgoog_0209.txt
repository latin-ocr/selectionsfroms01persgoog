l. sammaa. pediyreea. The wangiam of anaestors in the atae
oi noblemen were painted maske of wax placed npon busta prepared
for the purpose. These busta with the pertrait-maske were arranged
in little shrines (canaam), under which inscriptions (titani) pro-
claimed the names, honore, and exploits oi' the ancestore. The
imagines were encircled with wreaths (stemmata), running from one
to another in such a way as to indicate the genealogical connection
of the persons represented. Some scholare suppose that the Romane
had family-trees, resembling our own in form, on which were siriall
medallion portraite (pictae auitae, imagines pictae), encircled by
wreathe running from nne io another; and interpret Plin. H. N.
xxxv. 2, and San. de Bm. iii. 28, in this manner, rather than in ac·
cordance with the explanation given above. '

Ponticus was some young noble, to whom Juvenal addressee thie
satire in the form of an epistle.

8. Pictos vultus maiorum. The waren maske, or the painted facee
on the family trec: in either case, tite portror’ta os ooe'a amatore.

deq. The only hismrical Aemilianus when this was written was
the younger Scipio, P. cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, who gained the ·
agnomen Africanus. Triumphal etatueeare probably meant, although
paintings may be referred to (linrq. 5, 1, litia-Dimidios, draken
e'n hohi. -Umeroe minorem, “short oi' a head and ehoulders.”

7. It must be that this verse is an interpolation. What the inter·
polator meant by contingere virga is doubtful. Virga hasbeen taken
for the foeces, for a droam to keep the busta clean, forawancl with
which the busts are pointed ont, and for a brooch of the ancestral trae
(like romae (Pers. iii. 28), liaeo). In the latter case, nausiate multa
contingere virga, to ronch, through many a brooch.

·8. The ancient imagines of the masters of the horse are dingy with
emolre from the focae in the atrium.

9. doram Lepidis. like ante Numantinae (11). under the very eyes
of great and noble ancestors. i. e. in the presence oi their imag-inea.

Qno‚to mhot purpose. cf. verse 142, Hor. Epp. i. 5, 12. Quo: ,

quam ad rem. Cf. Cic. pro voello 52: dixeritne Clodiae qiaam ad
rem aurum sumeret; Id. 53: ‹lirit profecto qno vellet aurum.

11. Numantinus was an agnomen given to Scipio Africanus the
younger aiter the capture of Numantia, Β. c. 133. The plural is
generio, as in verse 13, and i. 109. cf. Cic. pro P. Sestio 68: qnare
imitemur nostros Bruma, Camillos.

12. Qua, so. tmpore-nume, those generals, your great ances-
tare.
