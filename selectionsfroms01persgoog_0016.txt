only genuine productione of Juvenal preserved to us,
aud they themselves are disfigured with interpolatione,

and eleventh‚ are the tasteless forgeries of some unknown

That there is a marked difference between the two

the disputed serires, - whatever their defecta-to which
the world will never refuse its admiration.

Ribbeck has probably succeeded in opening a question
which will never be fully settled. The vital defect, how-

ever, of his argument lies in the impossibility of fixing
