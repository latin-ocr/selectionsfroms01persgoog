⁸³. Bruttidius Niger was a distinguished orator and rhehrrician in
the time of Tiberius. He was probably a partisan cf Sejanus, and
trembled lest he should share his fate. — The altar ei llere was in
the Campus Martius.

qu. “I very much i'ecr lest the batiled Ajax will wreak his
vengeanee upon him, sor his feeble defenee.” Lewis explains the
reference of vietus Aiax to Tiberius as follows. “The poet has in
his mind the legend of Ajax conquered by Ulysses, and the mad
rege which seized on him after his defeat, when he butehered the
sheep, thinking they were his enenries. So the speaker is repre-
sented aa fearing that a similar butehering srenzy will seize Tiberius,
whom he compares to Ajax, and, as Ajax was conquered, he affixe
the epithet victas to him, without seeming to notice that it does not
fit Tiberius. ‘I arn afraid that we are going to have a repetition of
the story ofeonquered Ajax,- an undiscriminating masscere' ” In
like manner Maeleane commenta on male misnens: “Under the
characteres Ajax, enraged with the leaders of the army for not tak-
ing his part against Ulysses [Sejanus], the man means Tiberius, who
ln his letter to the senate expressed great alarm, and begged them to
send onc of the consuls witha guard to conduct him, a poor solitary
old man, to their presence. These apprehensiens, whether real or
pretended‚ the senate might well sear would be visited on them, and
they hastened tn remove the cause ef thern, and everybody eon.
neeted with him. This is what Niger had to fear.”

Madvig t Opaca. i. 44) proposes a very different explanation. The
controversy between Ajax and Ulysses, he says, for the arms os
Achilles, was a frequent subjectior declamationes [cf. vii. 115), end
had been taken hythe rhetorician Brutidius, who esponsed the cause
of Ajax. The speaker says, jokingly, he fears AJax is going io
exiret the penalty of the death of the deelairner, for his frigid de-
fense of his cause. Mayor and Anthon tbllow Madvig.
