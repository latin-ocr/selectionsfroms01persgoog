“When that this body did contein aspirit,
Δ kingdom ior 11 was too small a bound;
But now, two paces oi the vilest earth

, Is room enough.”

174. Juvenal now takes Xerxes as his example. Traces nithe
ship-oanal cut to avoid the dangerous promontory of hlount Athos
are still visible‚ although Juvenal treats the story as an invention.-
The final syllable ο1 Athos, though short, stands ior a long syllable
by the aid ο1 the caesural pause.

178 oq. Constratam . . . mare. This refers to the bridge ο1 boats
over the Hellespont. Cf. Lucret. iii. 1029 eqd-Ribbeck has coo·
· tructam, the reading oi P o prima mona. Some MSS. have carp
atratum, which Kiser would adopt.

178. The punctuation is Kiaer’s. Editors generally put a semi·

180 sq. Xerxes’s custom of flogging whatever winde opposed him,
making him a harder master than their king Aeolus (cf. Verg. Aea.
i. 52 eqo), may be a pluyiul invention of Juvenal’s.

1⁸2. Aeschylus (Pers. v. 745 eqd) and Herodotus (vii. 35) say that
Xerxes chained the Hellespont lor breaking his bridge.

188 sq. Tra is quite mercisah to be aare, that 11 did aot think him
