finest musio gives him no enj0yment. What matter where he sits at
the theatre? He cannot hear the very horns and trumpets. His
slave must bawl when visitors are anuounoed or when he tells him
what ’s o'olook. The blood runs oold and scanty in his veins, and it
requires a sever to keep him worm. A troop ot' all diseases danaes
around him ; so numerous Ι oould sooner reokon Hippia's lovers,
Themison's victims. how many villas my old barber has. One has
the rheumatism, one tha lumbago, one sciat-ies: this one is blind,
that one is fed by others ; he would grin once at the sight of dinner,
now gapes like a young swallow ior his food. But worstof all is
dotage that forgets its servants, friends, and children : makes a will
and gives its money to a harlot. But though he keeps his senses, he
must see his friends all dying round him. This is the penalty of
age, to pass its days in mourning for the dead. 246-267. Nestor of
eourss was happy, who lived to be asold almost as the arows. But
see him mournmg by Antilochus's gyre, asking what crime he had
done that he should live ιο long. ee Peleus weeping for Achilles,
Laertes for his waadering son. 258-288. Had Priam died before
the war of Troy, his sons had carried him to burial with solemn
rites and mourning women, his daughters at their head. What did
he get by living? He saw all Asia fall by fire and sword, theu ut
his armoron aud ran to the altar like an old ox to perish. is
death, however, was a man’s: his wife survived him and she died a
dog. But passing by Pontus's king and Croesus and the lesson
Solon gave him, look at Marius, exiled, im risoned, swamped, and
begging bread where he was late a viohrr. 'ho had been happier
had he breathed his last whep he came down from his triumphul
ahariot? Pompeius had a sever sent· him but the prayers of many
towns prevailed‚ and so his fortune saved him to lose an army and
his head. This Lentulus was spared, Cethegus too died whole, and
Catilina fell no mangled aaroass.

289-829. Mothers willv pray for beauty for their children. Why
should they not? Lucretia brds us ask not for form like hers: Vir·

blushing fase, great risks attend him. “But if he’s chaste, his
beauty will not hurt him.” N ay, did Hippolytus’s virtue profit him,
or did Bellerophon’s?

329-845. How would you oounsel silius. when Messalina had re·
solved to marry him? The best and handsomest, a noble youth, is
hurried to his death by the Empress's eyes. The veil is on her head,
the portion settled, and the auspices deelared. Is it a private busi-
ness? No, she must marryas becomes her state. Now make your
