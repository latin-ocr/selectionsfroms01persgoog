He seteht the froth off with a gallant sup.

Others still, less plausibly, understand that he dashes the heal-

coactos.

The examples given by Forcellini sufficiently prove that trsdlc
may mean either a ladle or a dedicatae-cap. Some suppose that its
meaning here is scaptiam or matella, and that suadas in this
passage is equivalent to anas. Heinrich argues ingeniously in favor
01 the scholiast’s first explanation, si pepederit, taking trulla astrea
as 000100 divitis. The second interpretation 01 the scholiast has
little probability: ai calix aureus crepitum dederit cadens e manu
divitis.

Stoic philosopher, grave 01 garb and mien‚ but treacherous, cratty,
avaricious, aud lustfnl. Egnatius was rewarded with riches and
honors: afterwards, however (0.1). 69), he was exiled.

Berytns; but he was educated at Tarsus, 11 the interpretation usually
given to verses 117, 118, is the correct one. The Gorgoneas cubui·

the Gorgon Medusa when Perseus struck off her head at Tartessus
in Spain. According to tho legend, he lost a wing (τανσὸς) at Tarsus,
on the beaks ofthe Cydnus in Cilicia, whence the city had its name.
Strabo (xiv. 673 sq.) says 01 Tarsus iu his day, “with such acal do
