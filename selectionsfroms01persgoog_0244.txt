sarran XI. 237

listen to your dinner. A young kid from my farm, and wild herbs

thered by my gardener's wife; fresh eggs warm in the nest, and
ξὲιιε that laid them3 grnpes fresh aa when plucked; the finest pears
and apples, the crude iuice dried from out them. Such was the dmner
of our senators when first they grew lnxurious. The herbshe gathered
in his little garden, such as a ditcher now turns up his nose at, Curius
would boil with his own hand. 'The flitch hung up to dry in former
times they kept for holidays, and lard for bi rthdays for their blood re·
latinns, aud part of the victim's meat. The great man who had thrice
been consul, dictator ton, went to such feasts stalking along with spade
upon his shoulder. In the strict Censor's days no one would ask what
sort of turtles might be found in thesea, to ornament the rich man's
couch: they were content with a rude ass’s head. Their food and
house and furniture were plain alike. Unskilled in art, the cups
they got for plunder tho soldiers broke to ornament their harneas or
their helmets. The only silver that they had adorned their arms.
Their homely fare was served in earthenware. If you're inclined
to envy, you might envy those good times. The gods were nearer
unto men; they warned the city of the Gauls' a proach, such care
for Rome had Jupiter when made of clay. The tables then were made
of home-grown wood. But now the richest viands have no flavor

129-182. I'll baveno guestgthldn, who delpises poverty. I have
not an ounce of ivory in all my house; the very handles of my
knives are bone; and yet they do not ⁵ss⁰ss the meat, or cut the
worse for that. And I've no carver tang tby first-rate artist, who
teaches them to cut up all fine dishes. My man ’s a novice too, and
cannot filch except in a small way, a chop or so. I’ve only a rough
boy in woollen clothes tooffer you my vulgar herbs, no eastern
bought for a vast price from dealers. Whatever you may ask for
ask in Latin. They aliare dressed elika, their hair cropped straight,
combed out to-day ιη honor of my guest; boys from the sarm‚modest
as those should be who wear the purple. One shall bring you wine
grown on his notive hills. And for our sports, we 'll read what
Hoffer wrote aud his peer Maro. It matters not what voice recites
suc verses.

rsa-208. But come, put care away and take a rest. We 'll have
no word of debts or jealous thoughts; before m door you must put
off all this, home and its troubles, slaves and tlleir breakages‚ and,
worse than all, the ingratitnde of friends. The great Idaean games
are going on. The praetor, victim of his horses, sits as a conqueror
in triumph; all Rome (the multitude rnust {ardon me) has poured
into the Circus, arrd by that rhout I know t at Green has won the
day. For had it not, you might have seen the city all in mourning ason
that day of Cannae. Let boys go look at gamas, boys who can shout
rond bet and sit by girls they love. Let· my sbrnnk skin drink in
the sun, and put the toga off. To-day, an honr ere noon, you may go
to bathe: you must not do so every day of the six, for even such a
life es that would pall. Pleasures are sweeter sor unfrequent use. -
Macestus, with modryiooa'om.
