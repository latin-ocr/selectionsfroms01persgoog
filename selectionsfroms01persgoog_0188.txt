SATIRE VII.

ARGUMENT.

1-10. 'l'rrrt hope and notive of our studies isin Caesar only. He
onl cares for the Muses in these times when poets leave the vales ol
Helicon und live by bathe, by baking, or by auctioneering. For if
Pierian woods won’t give you breud, you must e’cn ply the oner's
trade. And this is better than to rise to wealth by the base art of
lyin in the courts, though Asiatic and Cappadocian end Bithynian
knig ts may do it. rv-at. choesorth, however, no poet shall be
dc raded to do dirty work. Up and bestir yourselvesl the prinoe is

ydss-dl. Bntga rare bard, none of your common sort, is made so by
a mind free from aare and free from all bitterness, loving the woods
and Muses’ sprin s. ’Τ is not i'or poverty to sing. Horace was lull
when he cried Euboe! What room for genius if other cares than for
his verse disturb the poet's breast? If Virgll had not had a servant
ond a tolerable house, the snakes had dropped from his Fury’s head,
her trumpet had been dumb. We expect forsooth that our poor
playwright should rise to the old cothurnus, who to produce his play

tent with his great ame, but what is farne to poor Serranus and
Saleius, suppose they get· it? Statius delights the town who crowd
to hear him ; but after ull he starves if Paris does not buy his play.
