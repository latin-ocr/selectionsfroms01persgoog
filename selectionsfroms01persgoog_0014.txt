⁸ of military promotior, though he was eighty years of age,

he was removed from the city, and sent to be praefectus
of a cohort which was stationed in the farthest part of
Egypt That sort of punishment was determined upon
as being suited to a light and jocular offence. Within
a very short time hc died of vaxation and disgust.'’ ι

There are things intrinsically difficult of credence in
this story, and it is told with great variations in the dif-
ferent manuscript lives. The part of the offended empc-
ror is played by Nero aud Trajan, as wellas Domitian,
and three of the lives make Sootland the scene of the
exile, whither Juvenal is seut as praefectus militum in
the hope that he would be killed in battle. Of recent ·
scholare who accept the banishment, Hermann makes
Domitian send the satirist to Scotlaud, Friedldnder dates
the event under Trajan, with whom the actor Pylades
had great iufiuence, Ribbeck under Hadrian. Macleane
discredits the whole story, although allowing that, if
placed in the reign of Domitian, it is not chronologically
impossible. It is thought that Sidonius Apollinaris re·
fers to Juvenal in the lines, where, after mentioniug the
banishment of Ovid, he adds:

nec qui consimili deinde casu
‘ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram
iratifut't histrionis exsul. - Carra. ix. 270.

From the Satires themselves, it would appear that J u·
venal was most certainly writing after Domitian had
perished in A. n. 96, for he speaks of the death of that
emperor (iv. 153); and after the conviction of Marius
Priscus (i. 47), which we know to have taken place in
Δ. 1). 100. The thirteenth satire was probably written as
lateas Α. Ι). 127 (see verse 17); the fifteenth soon after
that date (seo verse 27).
