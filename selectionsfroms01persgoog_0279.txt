SATIRE XVI.

—0020400—

ARGUMENT.

1-o. OGnrmlt's, who can tell the advantages of lucky service? Give
me n crnok regiment, and 1 ’11 enlist and think my stans hove favored
nre. Ot' oourse a fortunate hour avails one more than if he hod a
lletter ot' reoomrnendntiou to Mars from his wife Venus or his mother

uno.

7-84. First, the uvlvantages that ull soldiers enjoy. T he greatest
is that no civiliun dares to strike yon, noy more, it' you strike him,
he holds his tongue, and dares not show his grievance to the praetor.
11Ι he would have revenge he has his judge, cstont centurion in the

onnn»‚sorsoldiers mo not go bff⁰¹¹d for trial. Most Just, no doubt,

is the centurion's Ju gment, an if I’ve right upon my side he ’ll
give rue satisfaction. But ull the camp will see that my revenge shall
prove a greater trouble than the wronff. And he's a bold man who
would dure otl'end so mnnyboots an hobnails. And who would
comeso far to eive his evidence? Let's dry our tears, nor trouble
friends who will not fail to excuse themselves. Theman who dores
to witness to the assuult is worthy ot' the good oldcn times: a lying
witness moy he oasier got against a townsmun than a true against a
soldier’sfortnnes ond his honor.

86-10. And if u sconndrel neighbor moves my landmark or
debtor will not give me back my own, then I must walt end go
through all the law's delays; bnt soldiers nro allowed their own time
sor snrng and no drag stops their snit.

51-60. The soldier too moy make a will while yet his father lives,
for all he gets in service is his own. The old man therefore courts
his lucky soldier who by fair favor is rewarded as his gallcnt deeds
deserve„ For ’tis the general's interest that the breve should also
he the lucky and pride themselves upon their trappings and collam.—
MACLEANE, with modificatione.

to whom this unfinished satire is addressed.
